# Welcome to the blinkenlights project

Duing a sleepless night the idea of an ESP-01S based LED backlight was born.
The backlight consist of 16 LED pixels controled by an ESP-01S. Every pixel
can be accessed and set to a 24-bit true color value.

## License rules

**blinkenlights** is provided under the terms of the CERN-OHL-S license version 2 as
provided in the LICENSES/CERN-OHL-S-2.0 file.

Instead of adding license boilerplates to the individual files, **blinkenlights**
uses SPDX license identifiers, which are machine parseable and considered
legaly equivalent.

The SPDX license identifier in blinkenlights shall be added at the first possible
line in a file which can contain a comment. This is normally the first line
except for scripts. Scripts require the #!PATH_TO_INTERPRETER tag in the
first line; place the SPDX identifier into the second line.

The SPDX license identifier is added in form of a comment.
